## Features

###  üë§ Create Agents
Create new agents, edit their configuration and organise them into folders.<br>
Multi-member workflows can be saved as a composite agent and nested infinitely.

### üìù Manage Chats
View, continue and delete previous workflow chats and organise them into folders.<br>
Chats can be exported and imported as .<br>

### üë• Multi-Agent Workflows
Seamlessly add multiple agents (or users), and configure how they interact with each other.<br>
Agent pilot supports group chat natively, but can be modified with a plugin:<br>
[CrewAI](/) *(All workflow agents **must** be a CrewAI agent, or else native will be used)*
<br>
[Create a workflow plugin](/)

### üå± Branching Workflows
Messages can be edited and resubmitted, and code can be edited and re-run.<br>
Allowing for a more practical way to chat with your workflow.<br>
Branching works with all plugins and multi-agent chats.<br>

### üî† Context Blocks
Manage a list of context blocks available to use in any agent system message.<br>
Allowing reusability and consistency across multiple agents.<br>
Block types:
- **Text** - A simple text block that can nest other blocks.
- **Code** - A code block that is executed and gets the output.
- **Prompt** - A prompt block that gets an LLM response.

### üî® Tools
Create, edit and delete tools, configure their parameters, code, language and environment.<br>
Tools can be added to an Agent or used individually as a workflow component.<br>

### üîå Plugins
Agent Pilot supports the following plugin types:
- **Agent** - Override the default agent behaviour.
- **Workflow** - Override the default workflow behaviour.

These agent plugins are built-in and ready to use:<br>
[Open Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter) 
<br>
[OpenAI Assistant](/)
<br>
[CrewAI Agent](/)
<br>
[Create an agent plugin](/)


### üíª Code Interpreter
Open Interpreter is integrated into Agent Pilot, and can either be used standalone as a plugin 
or utilised by any Agent or context block to execute code.
<br>
Code auto-run can be enabled in the settings, but use this with caution, you should always
understand the code that is being run, any code you execute is your own responsibility.<br>
Try something like "Split this image into quarters" and see the power of Open Interpreter

### üìÑ Tasks
~~Tasks are being reimplemented, coming soon!~~

### üïó Scheduler
~~Tasks can be recurring or scheduled to run at a later time with requests like _"The last weekend of every month"_, or _"Every day at 9am"_.~~
Still in development, coming soon.

### üëÑ Voice
Agents can be linked to a text-to-speech service, combine with a personality context block and make your agent come to life!<br>
